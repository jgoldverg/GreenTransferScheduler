A few things regarding this repo that are probably useful to know if you wanna use it.

1. There are two core directories: simgrid_environment, and scheduler_cli. These two repos are related and both work together.


## Scheduler ClI:
This directory is a python cli of a scheduler implementation that creates an xml file modelling the parameters that simgrid should use.

## Simgrid Environment
The run.sh script is how you run the project but you 

## How to run this stuff.
Build Dockerfile: 
```docker build -t simgrid-container .```
Now run it
```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace simgrid-container```

Ok so you will have an open terminal to the docker container that mounts the current directory into the container so that you can run the simgrid simulations in it.
The simulatins output a json file using the naming pattern of the xml file you pass to it.
```./run.sh /workspace/config/simgrid_configs/jgoldverg@gmail.com_ccuc_network.xml 4 10000000000000 ```
We are compiling and running main.cpp with the xml file being passed to it(generated by the scheduler_cli) and then saying we want 4 flows moving a total of 10TB.
